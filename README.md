LISM Implementation using Python 3.6, based on the beautifully written paper by S.Kumar, C.v. and Jawahar, [Logical Itemset Mining](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6406407&isnumber=6406400).

## Libraries Used:
 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): DataFrame Operations
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/): nD Array Manipulations

`Please Note that this implementation is for my "Code Smell Project" and most parts are specific to that. Please feel free to contribute and make a generalized implementation!`
